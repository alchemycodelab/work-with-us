# Interviewing at Alchemy

Beyond normal interview discussions, we ask prospective candidates to complete the following tasks below as
part of our interview process.

## Short How-To Lecture

A 15 minute lecture/how-to on a non-technical topic in front of Alchemy staff. Often works well to choose a 
hobby or passion you have outside of tech.

### Why?

We are looking to see how you process and organize information as well as your ability to "unpack" or take the 
audience through the information. We ask you to pick a non-technical topic in order to have you engage new material
versus a topic you may already be very familiar with presenting, and to make the topic accessible for our non-instructional 
staff who will help evaluate.

This is also our first chance to see your demeaner and presentation style.

### Hints

Expect the question "What sort of exercises should you have students do to learn this material?" at the end of your talk.
Remember we are a vocational school and the goal of instruction is to enable people to do things.

## Guest Lecture

A one hour guest lecture in front of a class on a topic relevant to their curriculum. We will work with you to pick a topic.

### Why?

We want to see how you handle yourself in front of real class. Requires organization, curration and time manangement. 
Also let's us see how you interact with students as well as their response to you.

## Code Deep-Dive

A 30 minute code discussion lead by you with one or two other developers. Ideally a project of yours, but can be other
code, blog post, or an open source project as well. Imagine we are new developers and you are there to introduce as to the code.

### Why?

We want to get a sense of who you are as a technologist. How you talk about code, field questions, and 
what you are interested in technically.
