Instructors at Alchemy Code Lab
===

Alchemy Code Lab is looking for full-time and contract Instructors.

Code schools have redefined tech education, now we're redefining the academic faculty experience! Come work with us:

* Primary responsibility is to provide advanced instruction and mentoring for people transitioning to a career as a software developer. We offer the most advanced training in Portland, our grads are ready to be contributors, not project/opportunity hires.

* For employees, you get 6+ weeks a year to contribute to tech and tech communities you love (or build your own!) through open source projects and contributions, tech research, and/or speaking engagements.

* Apply technology innovations to real projects in our App Lab consultancy. Our grads build build real MVP apps for local entrepreneurs.

This is an opportunity to impact people's lives, Portland's economy, and the technology community!
