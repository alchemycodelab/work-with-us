## About

### Instructors at Alchemy

Being an instructor at Alchemy is a next step for senior software engineers and developers. It is an opportunity to share accumulated experience and synthesize current best practices, designs, architectures, and approaches to modern software development. Candidates should be looking for new challenges that continue their interests in technology; experiencing a strong sense of community; and influencing a new generation of developers.

_We are more interested in experienced technologists than instructional backgrounds._

We **are** looking for many years of experience doing application development and several years of recent modern web development (preferrably using React) on products over a significant amount of their lifecycle.

### Compensation

* **Salary commensurate with industry experience: $110K - $180K**
* Fully paid medical, dental, and vision for you plus partner and kids
* Matching 401(k)

### Where

All instruction is currently being offered remotely. Alchemy is currently in Portland, OR and we are actively planning what hybrid tech training means in a post-pandemic world. We are open to instructors anywhere in the US, but let's discuss what our mutual long term future might look like.

## DE&I 

Since we founded Alchemy in 2016, increasing representation in tech among marginalized groups has been part of our mission. We have followed through on that commitment internally by investing in DE&I training and by providing staff tools and support to foster belonging and community. This includes focusing on how we are structured and our policies and practices. We also have continuously focused on attracting and supporting the growth of participants in our program from a number of underrepresented communities. We have work still to do, but we are deeply committed to doing the work to make Alchemy and our industry more inclusive.

## Responsibilities

Instructors lead classroom lecture and discussion, and work with their team of Teaching Assistants to support student lab and project work. We do not require our lead instructors to have prior experience leading classrooms. That being said you will need to: 

- Lead a group in a way that centers empathy and patience
- Use clear and effective verbal and written communications
- Lecture, lead discussions, and live code to groups of 20-35 students and connect in one-on-ones with clarity and warmth
- Take responsibility for fostering a safe and collaborative space 
- Be present and available to students, both in their technical training and professional development
- Offer honest and direct feedback, even when the message is hard to deliver
- Stay connected to the industry, keeping up to date on technology
- Leverage what you know with what excites you and bring that passion into the classroom
- Interpret and integrate feedback from students and fellow team members
- Uphold high standards for quality code and work
- Encourage the practice of writing quality code that can be sustained and maintained (don’t just teach “getting it to work”). 
- Model the qualities you believe make an outstanding developer

## Your Developer Experience

- Deep industry experience that is typically found in candidates that have over three years experience working in a production software development environment, including guiding a product across multiple releases and versions and experience in how things are done across more than one company or team.
- Insights based on both successes and failures, and qualities, both technically and collaboratively, that are important for an impactful developer 
- Collaboration with both  colleagues and technology leaders to help solve problems and challenges, navigate trade-offs
- You like to think about how you think about code and process. An advocate for clean and organized code and artifacts. You likely have some stories to tell about messy code and projects too.
-Track record of helping your teammates and sharing what you know. Also not afraid to ask for help, talk it out, or pick up something new
- Have left behind "needing to know it all" by trusting in your own ability to figure it out and learn.
