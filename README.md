# Interviewing at Alchemy

We ask prospective candidates to do the activites below as
part of our interview process. There is flexibility in ordering of steps
and are usually done on different days.

Our process is designed for us to observe you "in the wild" as well as an opportunity
for you to get a sense of what the job is like "for real".

## Short How-To Lecture

A 15 minute lecture/how-to on a non-technical topic in front of Alchemy staff. Often works well to choose a 
hobby or passion you have outside of tech.

### Why?

We are looking to see how you process and organize information as well as your ability to "unpack" or take the 
audience through the information. We ask you to pick a non-technical topic in order to have you engage new material
versus a topic you may already be very familiar with presenting, and to make the topic accessible for our non-instructional 
staff who will help evaluate.

This is also our first chance to see your demeaner and presentation style.

### Hints

Expect the question "What sort of exercises should you have students do to learn this material?" at the end of your talk.
Remember we are a vocational school and the goal of instruction is to enable people to do things.

## Guest Lecture

A one hour guest lecture in front of a class on a topic relevant to their curriculum. We will work with you to pick a topic
appropriate for the class. _We will compensate you with a $50 Powell's Gift Card for your time._

### Why?

We want to see how you handle yourself in front of real class. Requires organization, curration and time manangement. 
Also let's us see how you interact with students as well as their response to you.

## Lab Time

We would look for you to spend an hour with each of our classes (this can be done back-to-back) during lab time. This entails
reading the room, asking students prompting questions, and working directly with students who need help.
_We will compensate you with a $100 Powell's Gift Card for your time._

### Why?

We want to see how you read a room, approach students and interact one-on-one. We also are looking to see how you guide 
students through issues as well as provide corrective feedback.

## Code Deep-Dive

A 30 minute code discussion lead by you with one or two other instructor developers. Ideally a project of yours, but can be other code, blog post, or an open source project as well. Imagine we are new developers and you are there to introduce us to the code.

### Why?

We want to get a sense of who you are as a technologist. How you talk about code, field questions, and 
what you are interested in technically.

## Interviews

Interview time with staff including School Director, Career Services Director, and Instructors

### Why?

Get to know the team and have the team get to know you.
