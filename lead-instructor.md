Lead Instructor at Alchemy Code Lab
===

Code schools have redefined tech education, now we're redefining the academic faculty experience! Come work with us:

* Primary responsibility is to provide advanced instruction and mentoring for people transitioning to a career as a software developer. We offer the most advanced training in Portland, our grads are ready to be contributors, not project/opportunity hires.

* 6+ weeks a year to contribute to tech and tech communities you love (or build your own!) through open source projects and contributions, tech research, and/or speaking engagements.

* Apply technology innovations to real projects in our App Lab consultancy. Our grads build build real MVP apps for local entrepreneurs.

This is an opportunity to impact people's lives, Portland's economy, and the technology community!

## About You

### Tech

We're looking for people with significant work experience in the technologies we teach.

### Communication

You need to be a good communicator, especially in breaking-down and explaining things. Willing to try multiple approaches and techniques to get across key points 

### Empathy

Our program is intense and demanding and we train the whole software developer. It's hard work for students and we need to be clear about how there are doing. Respect and
compassion are needed, along with integrity and honesty.

## Curriculum

We are part of the _Powered By Code Fellows Network_, using curriculum that has placed thousands of students into jobs yet is always evolving to stay current.

## Technologies

We are currently looking people with significant work experience in these areas:

* _React/Redux_ (Vue and Ember okay if you are willing to learn React) and _advanced modern JavaScript_
* _Web Development/Devsign_: html, css and UI/UX FTW!
* Strong _agile engineering_ practices
* Nice to have:
    * Serverless (Google and AWS)
    * Backend JavaScript (Express, Mongoose, MongoDB)
